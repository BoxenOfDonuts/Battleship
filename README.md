# Battleship

This project was my first attempt at a complex project using TDD.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
It feels like I'll do a hard project, then the next couple are easy. Then I get hit with a big fat hard project again. This was definitely one of those hard ones. The logic for tracking ships on the board took a few iterations to get where I wanted it, and to make some sort of sense. Once I had that figured out, it was just a matter of adding useful features!
